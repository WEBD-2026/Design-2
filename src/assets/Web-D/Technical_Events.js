    "rules": " Team Size : 2-3 people \n \n . Only a writing implement will be allowed. No calculators, formula sheets, or extra paper are permitted. Scrap paper will be provided.\n2. There will be three rounds.\n3. All integrals will be indefinite.\n4. Students do not have to write the arbitrary constant (+C) to get a correct solution. They must, however, undo all substitutions and thus present a solution in terms of the original variable.\n5. The integrals will increase in difficulty from round to round, and within each round as the round progresses.\n6. An answer is acceptable as long as it is a solution for the original problem on an open interval (any open interval). So for example, ln(x) is an acceptable solution to \u222b dx because it is a solution on (0, \u221e).\n7. Check Rule: A Team during the competition can ask the judge for a\n\u201ccheck\u201d at any time ONLY ONCE (relinquishing the ticket provided when you do so). The judge will offer one of the following non-verbal responses:\n(a) If the answer is correct: a check mark C. Congratulations!\n(b) If there is a mistake that changes the nature of the integral or the technique is entirely off and requires replacing significant portions of your work: an X. This means you have major errors. Try to fix them!\n(c) If there is a mistake that does not change the nature of the integral and could be fixed by changing your work in one or just a few spots: a circle mark. This means you have minor error(s).Try to fix them!\n(d) If the judge is unable to ascertain (for whatever reason) if the error is major or minor: a ?. This response is unlikely. Try to assess your own work and keep going!\nYOU MUST HAVE A CIRCLED ANSWER FOR THE JUDGE TO EXAMINE. Since time is of the essence you should ask for your check by raising your hand well before time runs out. Once you raise your hand you cannot change your mind. You may do this only once.\n8. Round 1: 2 Teams will come on board and will have 2:00 minutes each question to compute the integrals. Each team must get 3 integrals to solve at the same time, the team which will solve the question first and correct will get a point and the team which will have more points in the end will win. (In case of tie breaker teams will be given one integral to solve first to solve will win).\n\n10 teams will go to round 2.\n\n9. Round 2: 2 Teams will come on board and will have 3:00 minutes each question to compute the integrals which is a level higher than the previous round. Each team must get 4 integrals to solve at the same time, the team which will solve the question first and correct will get a point and the team which will have more points in the end will win. (In case of tie breaker teams will be given one integral to solve first to solve will win).\n\n6 teams will go to the final round which is round 3\n\n10. Round 3: 2 Teams will come on board and will have 5:00 minutes each question to compute the integrals which is a level higher than the previous round. Each team must get 5 integrals to solve at the same time, the team which will solve the question first and correct will get a point and the team which will have more points in the end will win.
